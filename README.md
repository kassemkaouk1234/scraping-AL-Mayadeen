## Classes Overview

### Article
A dataclass that represents an article with the following attributes:
- url: The URL of the article.
- post_id: The unique identifier for the article.
- title: The title of the article.
- keywords: A list of keywords associated with the article.
- thumbnail: URL of the article's thumbnail image.
- publication_date: The date when the article was published.
- last_updated: The last updated timestamp for the article.
- author: The author of the article.
- full_text: The full text content of the article.

### SitemapParser
A class responsible for parsing the sitemaps and retrieving article URLs. Methods include:
- get_monthly_sitemap(): Fetches the list of monthly sitemaps from the main sitemap.
- get_article_urls(sitemap_url): Extracts article URLs from a given sitemap URL.

### ArticleScraper
A class responsible for scraping individual articles. It includes:
- scrape(): Scrapes the article's content and metadata, returning an Article object.

### FileUtility
A utility class for handling file operations. It includes:
- save_to_json(articles, year, month): Saves the list of articles into a JSON file, organized by year and month.

## Limitations
- The script is currently set to scrape a maximum of 10,000 articles.
- If the lxml parser is not found, the script falls back to html.parser, which may be less efficient.
